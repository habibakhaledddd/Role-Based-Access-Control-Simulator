# Role-Based-Access-Control-Simulator

##  Overview
This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Simulator** designed to demonstrate how access permissions are managed based on user roles.
It simulates real-world authorization mechanisms commonly used in secure systems.
##  Project Objectives
- Demonstrate RBAC concepts clearly
- Show how roles, users, and permissions interact
- Simulate access control decisions (Allow / Deny)
- Provide an educational demo
