Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a widely used security model where access permissions are assigned to roles rather than individual users.
--
This repository contains a **simulator and presentation** to demonstrate RBAC concepts in a simple and understandable way.

##  Project Objectives
- Understand RBAC fundamentals
- Simulate user, role, and permission relationships
- Demonstrate access decision logic
- Provide an educational demo
--
